****MIT807 AI Search Algorithms Visualizer**

**Project Overview**
This application provides interactive visualization of fundamental AI search algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), and Tabu Search. Designed for the MIT807 course, it helps students understand how different algorithms explore graph structures.

**Features**

**Interactive Graph Construction:**

Add/remove nodes and edges

Set custom edge weights

Clear entire graph

**Algorithm Visualizations:**

DFS with path highlighting

UCS with cost-based exploration

Tabu Search for optimization problems

**Visual Enhancements:**

Clear color coding (visited nodes in yellow, current node in red)

Step-by-step animation control

Adjustable animation speed
